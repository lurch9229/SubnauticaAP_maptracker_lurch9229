Changes made in V2.0:
--Logic has been updated to match the Subnautica Archipelago implementation
--Creature Tracking has been changed so that it shows only creatures that are randomized scans, and they now show up as a grid on the right instead of having their own tabs
--Added some new items and updated the layout so that all progression items are shown and some unnecessary and unrandomized items removed
--Added new items to display current logical depth, goal, and whether the player can reach their goal
--Added a settings page
--Reformatted the position of locations on the crater map so that they are very accurate with their locations in-game
--Locations and creatures now display the depth that they are found at
--Out Of logic (OOL) checks are now shown (checks shown out of logic either match the setting items_hard or easily skip a logically required item)
